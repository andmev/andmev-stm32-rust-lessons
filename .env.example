# Sentry Authentication Token
# Required only if you want to upload source maps for better error debugging
# Get this from: https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/
# Needs 'project:releases' and 'org:read' scopes
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=your-auth-token-here

# GitHub Pages Deployment
# Set to 'true' when deploying to GitHub Pages
# This adjusts the base path for assets and links AND enables strict CSP
#
# CSP Behavior:
# - GITHUB_PAGES=true  → Strict CSP with hash-based inline script/style approval (no 'unsafe-inline')
# - GITHUB_PAGES=false → Development CSP with 'unsafe-inline' for easier local development
#
# Local development should leave this unset or set to 'false'
GITHUB_PAGES=false
