# Introduction

Welcome to the **STM32 Rust** course. In this lesson, we will cover the basics of embedded programming with Rust on STM32 microcontrollers.

This is a paragraph with some _emphasis_ and **bold text**. You can also use ~~strikethrough~~ for deleted text.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

1. A computer (macOS, Linux, or Windows)
2. An STM32 development board
3. A USB cable
4. Basic knowledge of Rust programming

### Additional Requirements

- Rust toolchain installed
- `cargo` package manager
- STM32CubeIDE or similar development environment

#### Optional Tools

These tools can enhance your development experience but are not strictly required.

##### Very Specific Requirements

For advanced users, you might want to consider:

###### Even More Specific

This is the smallest heading level.

## Code Examples

Here's an example of inline code: `println!("Hello, STM32!")`.

And here's a code block:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut led = Led::new();
    led.toggle();
    println!("LED toggled!");
}
```

## Blockquotes

> Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

> This is a multi-line blockquote to demonstrate how blockquotes look with multiple paragraphs.
